## Core Features

### 1. Autonomous Security Analysis

Manus continuously monitors your security environment and performs:

- **Real-time threat detection** across all integrated security tools
- **Behavioral analysis** of users, systems, and network traffic
- **Anomaly detection** using advanced machine learning algorithms
- **Correlation analysis** of security events from multiple sources

**Configuration Options:**
- Severity thresholds (Info, Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- Focus areas (threat detection, vulnerability assessment, compliance)
- Time ranges for analysis
- Data source selection

### 2. Automated Incident Response

When threats are detected, Manus can automatically:

- **Isolate affected systems** from the network
- **Block malicious IPs** at firewall level
- **Disable compromised accounts** immediately
- **Preserve forensic evidence** for investigation
- **Initiate recovery procedures** based on incident type

**Supported Incident Types:**
- Data breaches
- Malware infections
- DDoS attacks
- Insider threats
- Compliance violations

### 3. Threat Intelligence Integration

Manus enhances your threat intelligence capabilities by:

- **Correlating IOCs** across multiple sources
- **Enriching alerts** with contextual information
- **Tracking threat actors** and their TTPs
- **Predicting attack vectors** based on current intelligence
- **Providing attribution** for security incidents

### 4. Compliance Monitoring

Automated compliance monitoring includes:

- **ISO 27001** control assessments
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** gap analysis
- **SOC 2** compliance tracking
- **GDPR** data protection monitoring
- **Custom frameworks** as needed

## Usage Examples

### Starting Autonomous Analysis

```javascript
// Example: Start threat detection analysis
const analysisRequest = {
  severity: 'high',
  focusAreas: ['threat-detection', 'anomaly-detection'],
  timeRange: {
    start: '2024-03-16T00:00:00Z',
    end: '2024-03-16T23:59:59Z'
  }
};

const taskId = await manusService.createSecurityAnalysisTask(analysisRequest);
```

### Initiating Incident Response

```javascript
// Example: Respond to malware incident
const taskId = await manusService.createIncidentResponseTask(
  'INC-2024-001',
  'Malware Infection'
);
```

### Monitoring Task Progress

```javascript
// Example: Check task status
const task = await manusService.getTaskStatus(taskId);
console.log(`Task ${task.id} is ${task.status} (${task.progress}%)`);
```
