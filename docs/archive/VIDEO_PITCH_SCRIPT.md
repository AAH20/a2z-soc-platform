## **OPENING SEQUENCE (0:00 - 0:30)**

**[VISUAL: Dark cybersecurity themed background with A2Z SOC logo animation]**

**NARRATOR (Professional, confident tone):**
"Every 11 seconds, a business falls victim to a cyberattack. The average cost? $4.45 million per breach. But what if you could transform your security operations while saving 70% on costs and achieving 240% ROI in just 5 months?"

**[VISUAL: Statistics appear on screen - "$4.45M average breach cost", "Attack every 11 seconds"]**

"Welcome to A2Z SOC - the AI-powered security platform that's revolutionizing how organizations defend against cyber threats."

## **PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION (0:30 - 1:30)**

**[VISUAL: Split screen showing traditional SOC vs. modern threats]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Traditional Security Operations Centers are broken. Organizations are spending $850,000 annually on security teams that can't keep up."

**[VISUAL: Cost breakdown animation showing traditional SOC expenses]**

"Let's look at the numbers:
- 15 to 20 security analysts required for 24/7 coverage
- 6 to 12 months for implementation 
- Over 1,000 daily alerts with 70% false positives
- 8+ hour average response time to critical threats"

**[VISUAL: Dashboard showing alert fatigue, response times]**

"Meanwhile, cyber threats are evolving at machine speed. Ransomware attacks have increased 300% in the past year alone. Organizations need a solution that matches the speed and sophistication of modern threats."

"Staff costs alone can reach $480,000 annually. With A2Z SOC, that drops to just $180,000 - a savings of $300,000 per year."

**[VISUAL: Infrastructure and tools comparison]**
"Infrastructure costs drop from $200,000 to $50,000. Tool licensing from $120,000 to just $20,000."

**[VISUAL: Incident cost reduction chart]**
"But the real value is in prevention. Look at this incident cost reduction over time. Before A2Z SOC, our customers averaged $125,000 per quarter in incident response costs. After implementation? Just $32,000."
