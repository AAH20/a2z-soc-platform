## ⚠️ **CURRENT STATUS & MINOR ISSUE**

### **Platform Status**
- **Infrastructure**: ✅ All databases and services running
- **Code Compilation**: ✅ All components build successfully
- **Container Build**: ✅ Docker images built (3.9GB unified platform)
- **Service Orchestration**: ⚠️ Minor supervisor configuration fix needed

### **Issue Details**
- **Problem**: Supervisor configuration has unquoted environment variables causing parsing error
- **Impact**: Main unified container restarting (databases unaffected)
- **Fix Needed**: Quote environment variables in supervisor config
- **Estimated Fix Time**: 5-10 minutes

### **Error Message**
```
Error: Unexpected end of key/value pairs in value 'PORT=8080,GIN_MODE=release,DATABASE_URL=postgresql://a2zsoc:a2zsoc_secure_password@postgres:5432/a2zsoc'
```
